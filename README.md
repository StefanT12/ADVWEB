Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This one saved me ' https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=51&v=e1LaekAnVIM&feature=emb_logo ', it's about deploying on heroku

First off, install MongoDB, otherwise it won't start.

Run " npm run-script install-all ". This should install all node-modules, build the project and 0

Start the server at http://localhost:8080/ 

Rebuild the project with " npm run-script build-start " then start the server at http://localhost:8080/
